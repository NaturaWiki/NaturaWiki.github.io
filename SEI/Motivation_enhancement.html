			<b>Motivation enhancement</b> is defined as an increased desire to perform tasks and accomplish goals in a productive manner.[1][2][3] This includes tasks and goals that would normally be considered too monotonous or overwhelming to fully commit oneself to.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			A number of factors (which often, but not always, co-occur) reflect or contribute to task motivation: namely, wanting to complete a task, enjoying it or being interested in it.[3] Motivation may also be supported by closely related factors, such as positive mood, alertness, energy, and the absence of anxiety. Although motivation is a state, there are trait-like differences in the motivational states that people typically bring to tasks, just as there are differences in cognitive ability.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Motivation enhancement is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as stimulation and thought acceleration in a manner which further increases one's productivity. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of stimulant and nootropic compounds, such as amphetamine,[2][4] methylphenidate,[2] nicotine,[5] and modafinil.[6] However, it may also occur to a much lesser extent under the influence of certain opioids,[7][8] and GABAergic depressants.
